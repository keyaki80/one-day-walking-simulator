## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-20

### Added
- **Complete room-to-window transition system**
  - 8-second smooth transition with three phases
  - Standing up animation (2 seconds)
  - Walking to window with bob animation (4.4 seconds)
  - Window focus and expansion (1.6 seconds)

- **Realistic desktop PC environment**
  - Large CRT monitor (400x250 pixels) with scan lines
  - Detailed keyboard with individual keys (F1-F12, QWERTY layout)
  - Monitor stand and realistic positioning
  - Retro green-screen terminal interface

- **Large window behind display**
  - 500x180 pixel window positioned behind CRT
  - Persistent window frame and cross dividers
  - Adaptive frame thickness based on scale
  - Enhanced visibility with shadow and highlight effects

- **Natural walking animation**
  - Realistic up-down bob movement during walking
  - Smooth camera transitions with easing
  - Time-based transition system for accurate timing

- **Time and season awareness**
  - Dynamic sky colors based on real-world time
  - Seasonal variations throughout the year
  - Room lighting adapts to time of day

- **Customizable experience**
  - Walking duration from 3-60 minutes
  - Large, accessible input interface
  - Clear visual feedback and instructions

- **Polished user interface**
  - No input cutoff issues
  - Large fonts for better readability
  - Intuitive click-to-activate input system

### Technical Features
- **Persistent window cross**: Cross dividers remain visible at all scales
- **Overlay rendering system**: Window frame drawn on top of walking scene
- **Adaptive graphics**: Frame thickness and cross visibility adapt to window size
- **Smooth animations**: Easing functions for natural movement
- **Real-time calculations**: Accurate timing and progress tracking

### Fixed
- Window cross disappearing during large-scale transitions
- Input box cutoff on CRT screen
- Inconsistent transition timing
- Frame rate dependent animations

### Performance
- Optimized rendering pipeline
- Efficient surface management
- Smooth 60fps animation
- Minimal memory usage
