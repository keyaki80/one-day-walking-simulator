### Suggesting Features

1. **Open an issue** with the "feature request" label
2. **Describe the feature** in detail
3. **Explain the use case** and why it would be beneficial
4. **Consider implementation** if you have ideas

### Code Contributions

#### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/one-day-walking-simulator.git
   cd one-day-walking-simulator
   ```
3. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes**
3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   python3 one_day.py
   ```
4. **Follow coding standards** (see below)

#### Coding Standards

- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8
- **Comments**: Use clear, descriptive comments
- **Functions**: Keep functions focused and well-documented
- **Variables**: Use descriptive variable names
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_CASE for constants

#### Example Code Style

```python
def draw_window_frame_overlay(self, window_rect):
    """
    Draw window frame and cross as overlay - always on top.
    
    Args:
        window_rect (pygame.Rect): Rectangle defining window area
    """
    # Calculate frame thickness based on window scale
    frame_thickness = max(4, int(8 / max(self.window_scale, 0.3)))
    
    # Draw frame with adaptive thickness
    frame_color = (100, 80, 60)  # Brown window frame
    pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, frame_color, window_rect, frame_thickness)
```

#### Testing

- **Manual Testing**: Test your changes thoroughly
- **Edge Cases**: Consider different screen sizes, input values
- **Performance**: Ensure changes don't significantly impact performance

#### Submitting Changes

1. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
   ```
2. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Create a Pull Request**
